6.10.16 

Today we went back on the Fuse Boxes where me and Dexter carried on the Strings chapter. His blogs still had to be fixed which was a shame. I learnt that the word 'input' means that when I put something into the command then it did the command, I had to reply in a way. It was very interesting and I very much looking forward to next week's lesson with the Fuse Boxes.
