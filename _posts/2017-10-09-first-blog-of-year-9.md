First blog of year 9

It's been a long time since Iâ€™ve done a blog and it feels good. In the past lessons we have been learning how to decipher codes. There are such things like concatenate which brings the code together by putting letters all into one cell. Also there is len which means length.

We have done this to understand where people use coding and why people use cod to make life easier.
