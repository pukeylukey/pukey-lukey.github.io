Today I worked with Guy because Dexter was ill. In the lesson we completed a monstrous 31 line code. Ite ended up a fun game where we have to guess a number with the computer saying if it is too high or too low. I managed to surprisingly get it with 8 go's to go. However Guy didn't do as well. It was ages since we went on the Fuse Boxes but it was fun to get back on them. I am looking forward to next week's lesson a lot.
