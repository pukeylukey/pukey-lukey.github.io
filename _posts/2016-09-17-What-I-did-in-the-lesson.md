What we did in the lesson 15/09/16

Today in our lesson we were doing fuse boxes again. Me and Dexter learnt that on it you can change the colour of the font and of the paper. You can also change the tempo that Hello World is being written on the screen. Me and Dexter had many troubles getting it to work considering we set up very quickly, it was constantly glitching. During the last few minutes of the lesson we enjoyed playing around with the colours and the fonts. We are looking forward to using the fuseboxes again in next lesson.
