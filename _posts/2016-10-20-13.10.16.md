Today me and Dexter went back on the Fuse Boxes where we completed two whole new sections in the book. One of the codes was an amazing thirty one lines of constant coding. In our recent code we did binary and we created a space invader and then made it bigger and then we made it say "I love space invader. That was today's lesson. Looking forward to next week.
