1.12.16

In this lesson we were given the choice of fixing our blogs or doing the fuse boxes. I decided to go with fixing my blogs because my blogs didn't look that great. I managed to change my avatar and my bio. It went really well. I haven’t managed to change my background as I don’t have style.scss in my account. I will be trying to improve as much as possible.
