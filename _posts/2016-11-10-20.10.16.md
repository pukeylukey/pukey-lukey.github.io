Today in our final IT lesson for the half term we went back on the Fuseboxes where me, Dexter and a newcomer to our duo, Harry did more coding. We did things to do with X,Y and Z and addition and subtraction. We didn't  do much but I learnt that if you changed something say X=3 and Y=4 then it equaled 7. If you changed X to 2 then you'd have to change the answer to 6. Overall it was a great half term and hopefully we will be carrying on with the Fuseboxes or even moving on to making a robot arm
