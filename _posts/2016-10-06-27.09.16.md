Today we went back on the Fuzeboxes. We went on to the section 3 where we were learning about String Theories. Also we talked about how we could make our blog names even more better and interesting. Today I learnt lots of new great things and I'm looking forward to next week's lesson and going back on the Fuse Boxes with Dexter again.
