Today in our IT lesson me and Dexter used the fuseboxes again and we completed the entire second section of the manual. We learnt about variables where you can make a loop such as saying "I have 6 apple I ate one and now I have 5 apples". It was things like that what we did. In total for one piece of coding it was 19 lines! We are really progressing anspd our looking forward to the next lesson.
